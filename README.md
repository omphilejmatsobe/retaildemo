# FULL STACK WEB APPLICATION

<!--Let's learn AVR assembly programming with an ATMEGA328P microprocessor. This is the first step to learning low-level programming.

## Introduction

Assembly is a low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
Processors only understand machine language instructions, 1's and 0's therefore machine language
is too complex for use in software development.
Low-level assembly language is designed for specific processors that represent various 
instructions in symbolic code and a more understandable form.

## General
<!--
* Assembly is not the easiest but can make things easier.-->
